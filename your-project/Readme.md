This is the first project I have done in the ironhak bootcamp. We only had 2 days to do this project and it was a very interesting starting point for all of us. The project itself is not perfect, but it was my very first achievement. There are three levels of difficulty, the first one is only guess one number between 0 - 9, the second one is to guess a number between 0 - 99 providing hints. The last one is to guess a number between 1000 - 9999, hints also provided.
